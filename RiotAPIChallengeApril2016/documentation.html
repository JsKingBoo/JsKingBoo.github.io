			If you've played this game already (you probably have; winning gives you a link here) you may or may not have noticed that "Masteromino" is similar to another game known as [Mysterious Negg Cave](http://www.jellyneo.net/?go=mysterious_negg_cave). (You need a Neopets account to play.) I swear that I didn't completely rip the concept from Mysterious Negg Cave; I did a similar puzzle when I was in third grade, but trying to figure out the name of the original puzzle just led me to Neopets. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The concept is somewhat straightforwards. You have a 3x3 board that has to be filled by unique champion/mastery pairs. The final layout of the board should contain all the hints, which are in the shape of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino">polyomino</a>. In a way you can think of this game as "advanced tetris", to an extent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Playing this game with pencil and paper is very easy, but constantly designing new puzzles and solutions gets somewhat repetative and even downright boring at times. Wouldn't it be nice if you could solve ten of them in a single sitting? (And without logging in and feeling the guilt of leaving your Neopet for the last six years, you sick monster.)

		<p>
			The majority game code is stored in the files <b>index.html</b> and <b>gameEngine.js</b>. The folder <b>assets</b> holds all the images utilized in the game; they are images of the brawlers and a formatting helper, respectively. Although the names of the files may seem to be some sort of arcane computer science buzzword, they can be boiled down to "any file ending with .html is a webpage, any file ending with .js holds code, and a folder holds other files."
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="interface">The Interface</h2><div class="totop"><a href="#backtotop">Back to top</a></div>
		<p>
			Throwing code everywhere is known as a "special organization scheme" for the programmer and "a huge mess" for everyone else. However, shoving all the necessary code to run a program in a single file can also lead to an organization fiasco: they should be partitioned in some way. In this project, I decided that the <b>index.html</b> should contain the GUI holders, <b>gameEngine.js</b> should contain the code that runs the programs, and that <b>assets</b> holds all non-code items such as images.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is a brief overview of the interface of Masteromino:

		</a>
		<p>
			Since there are effectively two "screens" in this application I suppose we look at the first one first. The initial input screen's layout looks something like this:
		</p>
		
		
		
		<div class="well well-sm">
&lt;div id="initial-input-wrapper" style="text-align: center"&gt;
	&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
		&lt;label for="start-difficulty"&gt;Start Difficulty&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;select style="inline" class="form-control" id="start-difficulty"&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;0 - Tutorial&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;1 - Easy&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;2 - Normal&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;3 - Hard&lt;/option&gt;
		&lt;/select&gt;
		&lt;label for="userName"&gt;Summoner Name&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;input class="form-control" id="userName" placeholder="Name"/&gt;
		&lt;label for="region"&gt;Region&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;select style="inline" class="form-control" id="region"&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;br&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;eune&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;euw&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;jp&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;kr&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;lan&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;las&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;na&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;oce&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;ru&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;tr&lt;/option&gt;
		&lt;/select&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;input type="submit" class="btn btn-default" onclick="trigger(true);" value="Submit" /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt; 
	Select your top champions if the API connection is broken (it probably is):
	&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
		&lt;label for="champion0" id="forchamp0"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;select style="inline" class="form-control" id="champion0"&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;Aatrox&lt;/option&gt;
			&lt;option&gt;Ahri&lt;/option&gt;
			...
			&lt;option&gt;Zyra&lt;/option&gt;
		&lt;/select&gt;
		&lt;label for="champion1" id="forchamp1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;select style="inline" class="form-control" id="champion1" disabled&gt;
		&lt;/select&gt;
		&lt;label for="champion2" id="forchamp2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;select style="inline" class="form-control" id="champion2" disabled&gt;
		&lt;/select&gt;
		&lt;label for="champion3" id="forchamp3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;select style="inline" class="form-control" id="champion3" disabled&gt;
		&lt;/select&gt;
		&lt;label for="champion4" id="forchamp4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;select style="inline" class="form-control" id="champion4" disabled&gt;
		&lt;/select&gt;		
		&lt;input type="submit" class="btn btn-default" onclick="trigger(false);" value="Submit" /&gt;		
	&lt;/div&gt;			
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
	for (var i = 0; i &lt; boardSize; i++){
		document.getElementById("forchamp" + i).innerHTML = "Champion " + (i+1);
	}
	for (var i = 1; i &lt; boardSize; i++){
		document.getElementById("champion" + i).innerHTML = document.getElementById("champion0").innerHTML; 
		document.getElementById("champion" + i).disabled = false; 
	}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div id="loading" style="visibility: hidden;"&gt;
	&lt;h1&gt;Loading Masteromino...&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;h6&gt;while waiting feel free to read this legal stuff. also, if you get error 429 wait like 10 seconds or something then refresh&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
		</div>
		<p>
			Notice how 
		</p>
		<p>
			Inside <code>container</code> are the divisions <code>stickybar</code>, <code>loading</code>, <code>previous_guess</code>, and <code>current_guess</code>:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>stickybar</code> holds the champion portrait data, and this bar never moves. Scrolling will have no effect on the position of the champion portraits relative to the window.</li>
			<li>The <code>loading</code> container simply contains a loading message that eventually gets deleted.</li>
			<li>The <code>previous_guess</code> container holds the "guess history" of the current game session. The images in <code>previous_guess</code> are unchangeable.</li>
			<li><code>current_guess</code> holds the user's -- you guessed it -- current guess. Unlike <code>previous_guess</code>, the images in it are changeable on click, and the images cycle from Razorfion >> Ironback >> Plundercrab >> Ocklepod >> Razorfin. <code>current_guess</code> also contains the "Submit Guess" and "Clear Guess" buttons which do exactly as their name says.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>	
			Here is a visual guide on which division relates to what game element:
		</p>
		<a href="#thumb2" class="thumbnail" id="#thumb2">
			<img src="documentation_images/documentation2.png" alt="Div ID to GUI guide" />
		</a>
		<p>
			Note that <code>stickybar</code> has the <code>position:fixed</code> property. As a result, scrolling will not move the contents in the <code>stickybar</code> container.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>index.html</b> also initiates the code in <b>gameEngine2.js</b> by setting up several global variables, calling the initiate function, then clearing placeholders once loading is finished:
		</p>
		<div class="well well-sm">
&lt;script&gt;
	//formatting + utility
	var w = window.innerWidth;
	var imgborder = 2; //px
	var imagewidth = (w * 9 / 100) - (imgborder * 2); //px
	var ch = 10;
	init();
	var displayContainer2 = document.getElementById("loading");
	displayContainer2.innerHTML='&lt;img src="filler.png" alt="" style="width:' + imagewidth + 'px;height:' + imagewidth + 'px" /&gt;';
	document.getElementById("contains").style.marginLeft=(imagewidth/2)+"px";
&lt;/script&gt;
		</div>
		<p>
			The variables <code>w</code>, <code>imgborder</code>, and <code>imagewidth</code> are used to format the game. I soft-split the interface into eleven vertical columns. Each column, except for the last, is 9/100 of the total screen width (The final column is sized at 10/100, or 1/10, of the total screen width). Except for the eleventh column, every column holds a champion and the user's guess on the brawler that said champion bought. <code>ch</code> is a constant to keep track of the number of champions in an average game of Summoner's Rift. The <code>init();</code> function loads the game.
		</p>
		<p>
			The final three lines of code completes the alignment of the game elements. The <code>loading</code> container's contents is replaced with an image behind the <code>stickybar</code> header so that the first guess isn't hidden. Then, the game container is center-aligned. The eleventh column is split into two columns of 5/100 (or 1/20) each, and these columns are softly placed on the left and right sides of the interface.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<h2 id="initialize">Initializing the Game</h2><div class="totop"><a href="#backtotop">Back to top</a></div>	
		<p>
			Now we move on to the real meat of the game. Opening <b>gameEngine2.js</b>, you'll see a lot of commented-out <code>console.log</code>s, a huge block of commented-out functions, and various comments that aren't exactly the best explanations for the code they pertain to.
		</p>
		<p>
			To begin, let's first look at the old and new variables and their purpose:
		</p>
		<div class="well well-sm">
	//formatting + utility 
	var w = window.innerWidth; 
	var imgborder = 2; //px 
	var imagewidth = (w * 9 / 100) - (imgborder * 2); //px 
	var ch = 10;
	
	//output variables
	var previousGuessHtml = '';
	var currentGuessHtml = '';
	var navbarHtml = ''; //technically it isn't a navbar but ok

	//gameplay handlers
	var champs = []; //random top jug mid sup adc top jug mid sup adc
	var currentGuess = ["3611", "3611", "3611", "3611", "3611", "3611", "3611", "3611", "3611", "3611"];
	var answer = [];
	var noOfGuesses = 0;
	var win = false;

	//item ID
	var razorfin = "3611";
	var ironback = "3612";
	var pluncrab = "3613";
	var ocklepod = "3614";
		</div>		
		<p>
			The group of variables labelled "formatting + utility" should already be familiar to you. Although these variables are not defined in <b>gameEngine2.js</b>, they are notable global variables that are heavily utilized in the dynamic formatting.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next group of variables (labelled "output variables") are strings that are assigned to the relevant division. <code>previousGuessHtml</code> is assigned to the <code>previous_guess</code> element, <code>currentGuessHtml</code> is assigned to the <code>current_guess</code> element, and <code>navbarHtml</code> is assigned to the <code>stickybar</code> element. Also, as my comment states, the <code>navbarHtml</code> technically isn't a navigation bar. It originally was, but halfway through the project I changed it to the current <code>stickybar</code> holder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thirdly, we come to the "gameplay handlers". The <code>champs</code> array holds the IDs of the champions in the <code>stickybar</code> in order. <code>currentGuess</code> holds the brawler IDs of the <code>current_guess</code> element. <code>answer</code> contains the correct brawlers in order. If <code>currentGuess</code> and <code>answer</code> match, the user wins. <code>noOfGuesses</code> counts the number of guesses that the player has made, and <code>win</code> is a boolean (true/false) flag to see whether the player has won or not.
 		</p>
		<p>
			The final set of variables are the item IDs of the brawlers except they are stored as strings. Actually, I think these variables are unused.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyways, enough with variables; now it's time to look at the actual initiation functions. The game begins with a call to <code>init();</code>; however, the funny thing is <code>init();</code> is simply a redirection to other functions.
		</p>
		<div class="well well-sm">		
function init(){
	//generateTeams();
	//generateAnswer();
	setUp();
	drawStickyHeader();
	drawCurrentGuesses();
}
		</div>
		<p>
			<code>setUp();</code> generates both the champion and answer data to be used during a game session. <code>champs</code> and <code>answer</code> used to be created separately, which is why <code>generateTeams();</code> and <code>generateAnswer();</code> are commented out. <code>setUp();</code> combines those two functions together. Then, the sticky header and the current guess UI is drawn.
		</p>
		<p>
			Speaking of <code>setUp();</code>, that function uses <b>champ-data.js</b> to pick a random champion/brawler pair. In the data set, every position contains a list of champions and the amount of times said champion has purchased X brawler. For example, if <b>champ-data.js</b> contained the following data:
		</p>
		<div class="well well-sm">		
"adc": {
	Ashe:[1, 2, 3, 4],
	Vayne:[5, 6, 7, 8],
	Malzahar:[0, 0, 0, 1],
}
		</div>
		<p>
			then the game engine would know that Ashe has bought a Razorfin once, an Ironback twice, a Plundercrab three times, and an Ocklepod four times. Vayne has bought a Razorfin five times, etc. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that <code>setUp();</code> random champ/brawler picker is weighted: using the above data set, Vayne would be the most likely ADC that the computer will pick, followed by Ashe. Champion weights are determined by the sum of their brawlers; Ashe would have a weight of 10, while Vayne would have a weight of 26. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>setUp();</code> also does not first find the champion, then the brawler; the implementation finds both at the same time. A random number is uniformly chosen between 0 (inclusive) and the sum of all weights, exclusive (in this case, 0 &lt;= random number &lt; 37). Let's say the number chosen is 21. Then, the weights are gradually added in order until the sum is strictly greater than the random number:
		</p>
		<div class="well well-sm">		
Current sum: 0; 
Add [0][0] (1); Current sum: 1; 
Add [0][1] (2); Current sum: 3; 
Add [0][2] (3); Current sum: 6; 
Add [0][3] (4); Current sum: 10; 
Add [1][0] (5); Current sum: 15; 
Add [1][1] (6); Current sum: 21; 
Add [1][2] (7); Current sum: 28 STOP
		</div>		
		<p>
			In my example, the chosen index would be [1][2], or Vayne/Plundercrab.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also visualize my random weighted champ/brawler picker as a large scale (god bless my MSPaint skills):

		<h2 id="ingine">The Game Engine</h2><div class="totop"><a href="#backtotop">Back to top</a></div>	
		<p>
			Alright, the game has just finished setting up, the <code>current_guess</code> array has been drawn, and now it's time to get to the meat of this game. Unfortunately, the mechanics of the game is surprisingly simple. (I still can't show off all my sorting algorithms; I'm so sad) In fact, the game engine mostly revolves around the <code>makeGuess();</code> function.
		</p>
		<p>
			Predictably, the <code>makeGuess();</code> function is called when the button labelled "Submit Guess" is pressed. First, the variable <code>noOfGuesses</code> is increased by one. Then, the current guess is "solidified"; in other words, the content in <code>current_guess</code> is passed to <code>previous_guess</code>. Note that when the data has been solidified, the cycle functionality of the buttons is removed. Finally, the number of correct and incorrect entries is calculated and presented. If the number of correct entries is equal to ten, then the game is won, and <code>win</code> is set to <code>true</code>. The next buttons presented is determined whether the player has won yet: if the player has not won yet, then "Submit Guess" and "Clear Guess" are re-presented. If the player has won, then "Reset Game" and "View Dossier" appears. The HTML is updated, and the windows will automatically scroll to the bottom of the page. 
		</p>
		<p>
			And that's pretty much it. No fancy concepts are involved, everything is boringly simple.
		</p>
		<p>
			The theory behind the engine is fairly straightforward, but when coding this I realized that checking a guess for correctness is actually slightly more complicated than I originally thought. So of course, I have to devote a few paragraphs elaborating it.
		</p>
		<p>
			When calculating the number of correct, misplaced, and incorrect guess keys, the game first fills a temporary variable <code>answerCount</code> which keeps track of the number of Razorfins, Ironbacks, Plundercrabs, and Ocklepods in the answer key:
		</p>
		<div class="well well-sm">		
//fill answerCount
var answerCount = [0, 0, 0, 0];
var usedAnswer = [];
for (var i = 0; i &lt; ch; i++){
	answerCount[answer[i]-3611]++; //"3611" is an adjustment to start the answerCount index at 0. also, beware the magic number!
}		
//sample result: answerCount = [3, 2, 4, 1] (3 Razorfins, 2 Ironbacks, 4 Plundercrabs, and 1 Ocklepod in the answer key)
		</div>			
		<p>
			You may have noticed that another variable called <code>usedAnswer</code> is declared. This helps count the number of misplaced brawlers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The game first finds the number of correct answers by simply comparing <code>answer</code> to <code>currentGuess</code>. It accumulates the number in a counter variable. When it finds a match, it also fills <code>usedAnswer</code> with a value of <code>true</code> and depletes the relevant <code>answerCount</code> value by one.
		</p>
		<a href="#thumb5" class="thumbnail" id="#thumb5">
			<img src="documentation_images/documentation5.png" alt="Visualization of finding correct guesses" />
		</a>
		<p>
			Then, the game engine moves on to calculate the number of misplaced elements. The engine no longer relies on <code>answer</code> directly but instead on <code>answerCount</code>: It cycles through the <code>currentGuess</code> array again, but ignores entries marked by <code>usedAnswer[]</code> and brawlers when its relevant <code>answerCount</code> stack is empty. In the example used above, the first and fourth brawlers will be ignored because <code>usedAnswer[]</code> has marked them while the second and fifth brawlers will be ignored because the <code>answerCount</code> stack is empty; only the 3rd brawler is misplaced.
		</p>
		<a href="#thumb6" class="thumbnail" id="#thumb6">
			<img src="documentation_images/documentation6.png" alt="Visualization of finding misplaced guesses" />
		</a>
		<p>
			Finally, the number of incorrect brawler keys is calculated using the simple formula:
		</p>
		<div class="well well-sm">		
incorrect = 10 - (correct + misplaced);
		</div>
		
		<h2 id="idataprocessing">Data Processing</h2><div class="totop"><a href="#backtotop">Back to top</a></div>	
		<p>
			While technically not part of the code, the <b>champ-data.js</b> took about 1000 games from NA to fill the data set. Obviously, filling <b>champ-data.js</b> by hand is not a feasible option; instead, I wrote the program <b>RiotApiBMBHelper.java</b> in Java to do it for me. You can find the program's source inside the <b>test</b> folder. The program relies on <a href="https://github.com/rithms/riot-api-java">rithms's Riot API Java wrapper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/gson">google-gson</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple">json-simple</a>. (Yes, I used two different JSON libraries; bite me.)
		</p>
		<p>
			I would have ran the program overnight for five hours to analyze all 10,000 matches from NA had the Riot API server not randomly return a 429 error. Additionally, because the Riot API library would terminate the program on a RiotApiException, and because I had no patience to implement exception handling (hehe), I could not automatically run it again. Therefore, I quickly coded two scripts to assist in the collection of data:
		</p>
		<a href="#thumb4" class="thumbnail" id="#thumb4">
			<img src="documentation_images/documentation4.png" alt="Test files" />
		</a>
		<p>
			I would take the raw data that I already had and stored it in the file <b>merge1.js</b>. Then, I would run <b>RiotApiBMBHelper.java</b> and let it grab as much match data as it could. After it crashed, the program would spit out the information it managed to get. I stored this second data set in <b>merge2.js</b>. Finally, I would open <b>merge.html</b> in my web browser. The script merged the data from <b>merge1.js</b> and <b>merge2.js</b>, then format the data so I could copy/paste the output back into <b>merge1.js</b>. I repeated this process until I crunched through enough matches. Currently, the count is 1504.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may have noticed another file unfortunately misspelled as "<b>finilize.html</b>". The function of this script is simple: it takes <b>merge1.js</b> and reformats the data so it can be easily copy/pasted into <b>champ-data.js</b>. This was mainly done for convenience; every time I wanted to add more match data, I did not want to reformat everything from my match cruncher by hand.
		</p>
		<p>
			To rephrase: <b>RiotApiBMBHelper</b> would accumulate data and store it in <b>merge1.js</b> with the help of <b>merge2.js</b>. After enough data has been gathered, <b>finilize.html</b> would export it to <b>champ-data.js</b> in the parent directory.
		</p>
