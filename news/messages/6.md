About two years after I made this thing, I have no idea why there are 9 preplaced messages here. Makes me wonder what kind of spaghetti my past self conjured.

It's quite a shame that none of the projects I wanted to build ever amounted to anything, but it was fun tinkering with them and I learned a bit from the experience. (However, if given the chance I'm never gonna do anything like that again)

There's also a lot of embarassing projects (such as this "News" tab...I believe this was supposed to be some sort of blog?) and the navbar at the top is really badly structured. I can already feel the website falling apart. There are not many projects on this site that I am proud of, and the navbar reflects the "best" projects I stuck on this site. Not a fan of that either now, mmmm.

The Riot API challenge in particular made me learn a lot about manipulating large data sets, and how performing processes alone will never amount to anything. Maybe I'll be a number cruncher when I grow up. Strangely it feels like it's easier to fail when you're good at doing things in life, so getting through daily life is surprisingly difficult. lol

I suppose I have to follow this signing thing as well. I like the day/month/year format I had going but dislike how I only included one digit of the month.
