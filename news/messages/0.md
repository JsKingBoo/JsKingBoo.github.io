I don't think I want the news feed to be indented, so I won't add one to this text file. However, it'll be cool if there was auto-word wrap. Oh, and it'll also be cool if I could decide what to *italicize*, **bold**, or even [link](https://www.google.com). I also want the news feed to be easy to add to. Yeah, that'll be cool as well.

I think I'll just use Markdown for standardization's sake
